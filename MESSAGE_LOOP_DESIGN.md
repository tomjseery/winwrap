# winwrap — message-loop design proposal

> **Renamed 2026-09-25:** `winwrap::run()` / `winwrap::quit()` are now
> `winwrap::message_loop::run()` / `winwrap::message_loop::quit()` (CODE_CONVENTIONS §6).
> The design record below keeps the names it was written with.

Design and implementation notes for the reusable message-pump runner. Applications
may use `run()` or retain their own native loop. Project rationale lives in
[VISION.md](VISION.md) and [CODE_CONVENTIONS.md](CODE_CONVENTIONS.md); current
limitations and future application-driven loop work are assessed in
[ASSESSMENT.md](ASSESSMENT.md).

## Status: implemented (2026-07-13)

Built and MSVC-verified in `libs/winwrap/include/winwrap/desktop/message_loop.hpp`
(`run()` + `quit()`) with four passing Catch2 tests in
`tests/winwrap/desktop/message_loop_test.cpp`. Historical paths below record the original
design. Two deltas from the
proposal below:

- **`quit(int = 0)` was added** — the proposal's Q5 originally said *not* to (see the
  correction in Q5). Reversed: `quit()` names user *intent* over the `PostQuitMessage`
  mechanism and is a genuine ergonomic wrapper, not a thin rename. It's the everyday
  user-facing exit call (an "Exit" menu item, a tray "Quit").
- **The `-1` sentinel is named `message_failed_code`** (not `get_message_failed`).

The three proposed tests plus a fourth (close-window → `on_destroy` → `quit()` →
`run()` returns) all pass.

## (a) Recommendation

Ship a single **header-only free function `winwrap::run()` returning `int`** (the
`wWinMain` return value, `msg.wParam`), in a new concept-named header
**`winwrap/message_loop.hpp`** — joining the existing `message_dispatcher.hpp` /
`message_reflection.hpp` family. The loop is *stateless*: the window already owns
`HINSTANCE` (`GetModuleHandleW(nullptr)`) and `nShowCmd` is consumed by
`show(cmd)`, so `run()` needs no arguments and no owning object — a free function
is exactly the right shape, and an `Application`/`MessageLoop` class would be state
without a reason to exist for the current bare pump. The implementation treats
`GetMessageW`'s `-1` return as **fail-fast**. Its fixed valid arguments avoid common
documented failure causes, but do not prove that the documented failure return is
impossible. Fail-fast is a chosen policy, not an established platform invariant.
Build
**only** the bare pump now; accelerators, modeless dialogs, and idle processing are
walled *open*, not *off* — the free-function entry admits a future defaulted
`RunConfig` overload without breaking a single caller (§1 config-struct convention,
§3 abstractions-late).

## (b) Prior art — how established Win32 wrappers structure the run loop

| Library | Entry point | Shape | Accelerators | Modeless dialogs | Idle / `-1` handling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **WinLamb** (Freitas Dias) | `RUN(cls)` macro → generates `wWinMain`; loop in `window_main::run_as_main` | free-ish, per-window | member `HACCEL` → `TranslateAcceleratorW` in-loop | `IsDialogMessageW` for dialog windows | throws on `-1`; no idle |
| **Win32++** (Nash) | `CWinApp::Run()` (singleton app object) → `InitInstance()` + `CWinThread::MessageLoop()` | heavy app+thread objects | `virtual PreTranslateMessage` calls `TranslateAccelerator` | `PreTranslateMessage` calls `IsDialogMessage` (modeless list) | `virtual OnIdle` + `PeekMessage` idle loop |
| **WTL `CMessageLoop`** (atlapp.h) | `CMessageLoop::Run()`, added to the thread | reusable loop object; filter + idle chains | each window's `PreTranslateMessage` in a **message-filter chain** | same filter chain (`IsDialogMessage`) | **ignores `-1` (`continue`)**; `OnIdle` chain + `PeekMessage` |
| **ATL core** (`CWindowImpl`) | none — wizard `_tWinMain` writes the loop inline | — | inline in generated `_tWinMain` | inline | inline |
| **MS `NotificationIcon` sample** | inline plain `GetMessage` loop | — | none | none | none (returns `msg.wParam`) |

**What every one of them returns:** `(int)msg.wParam`. That is the fixed contract
`run()` must honour.

**Reading of the field, applied to winwrap's pillars (VISION):**

- Win32++ and WTL grow the loop into an **object with virtual
  extension points** (`PreTranslateMessage`, `OnIdle`) and, in Win32++, a
  singleton `CWinApp`. A filter/idle adapter around the native pump is not by itself
  a replacement runtime. Their machinery exists
  to solve accelerators + modeless dialogs + idle *generically for many windows* —
  a problem winwrap does not have yet (one window, no accel table, no dialogs).
- **WinLamb** is closest to winwrap's spirit (header-only, no framework) and shows
  the minimum honest loop: `TranslateAccelerator?` → `IsDialogMessage?` →
  `Translate`/`Dispatch`. But its accelerator/dialog handling is welded into the
  window object via a `RUN()` macro. winwrap can start below even that — a bare
  pump — and add the two `if`s later behind a config, because the CRTP/deducing-this
  design means the loop never needs to know the window type.
- **The `-1` split is a policy choice.** The inspected WinLamb loop throws and WTL
  continues; Winwrap currently fails fast. Do not explain that difference through
  an unverified claim that the other loops accept arbitrary HWND filters. Future
  loop configuration should explicitly revisit failure reporting and preserve
  accelerator/modeless-dialog native semantics.

## (c) Proposed public API + usage

```cpp
#pragma once

#include "winwrap/win.hpp"

#include <wil/result_macros.h>  // FAIL_FAST_IF -- the terminate tier (windows/CLAUDE.md §4)

namespace winwrap {

/// Runs the thread's message loop until WM_QUIT, then returns its exit code --
/// the value to hand back from wWinMain. Pumps GetMessageW/TranslateMessage/
/// DispatchMessageW; dispatched messages reach each window's WndProc (and so its
/// compile-time on_* hooks). WM_QUIT arrives from PostQuitMessage -- post it from
/// your main window's on_destroy so closing the window exits the app.
///
/// @return The WM_QUIT exit code (msg.wParam), i.e. PostQuitMessage's argument.
/// @note   The current policy is fail-fast for GetMessageW's documented -1 error.
///         Valid fixed arguments avoid common failure causes, but do not prove
///         that the failure return is impossible.
[[nodiscard]] inline int run() {
    constexpr int message_failed_code{-1};
    MSG msg{};
    BOOL status{};
    while ((status = GetMessageW(&msg, nullptr, 0, 0)) != 0) {
        FAIL_FAST_IF(status == message_failed_code);
        TranslateMessage(&msg);
        DispatchMessageW(&msg);
    }
    return static_cast<int>(msg.wParam);
}

/// Ends the message loop: posts WM_QUIT so run() returns error_code. Call it from an
/// "Exit" menu handler, a tray "Quit" item, or a window's on_destroy.
inline void quit(int error_code = 0) { PostQuitMessage(error_code); }

}  // namespace winwrap
```

Call site (the whole point — `wWinMain` shrinks to this):

```cpp
int WINAPI wWinMain(HINSTANCE, HINSTANCE, PWSTR, int nShowCmd) {
    MainWindow window;
    if (!window.create({.title = L"Hello, winwrap"}))
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    window.show(nShowCmd);
    return winwrap::run();
}
```

## (d) The eight design questions

### 1. API shape — free function `run()` → `int`

**Free function `winwrap::run()` returning `int`.** Rationale: the loop holds *no
state*. It does not need `HINSTANCE` (the window grabs it via
`GetModuleHandleW(nullptr)` — `window.hpp:163`), nor `nShowCmd` (consumed by
`WindowHandle::show(cmd)` — `window_handle.hpp:40`). A function whose only job is to
drain the queue has nothing to own, so an `Application`/`MessageLoop` class would be
ceremony. It also matches every surveyed library's return contract (`int` =
`msg.wParam`) and reads cleanly qualified: `winwrap::run()`. `[[nodiscard]]` because
dropping the value means `wWinMain` returns garbage.

*Naming:* ROADMAP tentatively wrote `run_message_loop()`; I recommend the shorter
**`run()`** — the `winwrap::` namespace already supplies the "message loop" context
(WinLamb's `RUN()` precedent), and if an `Application` object ever lands it exposes a
`.run()` method with the free function staying as the thin entry point.

### 2. Error handling — `GetMessageW` returns `-1`

**Fail-fast, not `std::expected`, not throw, not silent-ignore.** The value-error
model (VISION pillar 5) exists to surface *recoverable failures the caller can react
to* — a class that won't register, a window that won't create, caused by the
environment or by arguments the caller supplied. `GetMessageW`'s `-1` is documented
to occur only for an invalid window handle or an invalid `lpMsg` pointer — **both
supplied by `run()` itself** (`nullptr` filter, a valid local `&msg`). So `-1` is
not a recoverable, caller-caused failure; it is an invariant break with no meaningful
recovery. That is exactly the tier `windows/CLAUDE.md` §4 assigns to `FAIL_FAST_IF`
("terminate"). Returning `std::expected<int, std::error_code>` would force every
`wWinMain` to unwrap an error that cannot happen, taxing the happy path (normal exit
is `WM_QUIT` = success) for nothing — the wrong shape for this call. WTL's silent
`continue` is rejected (hides an invariant break); WinLamb's throw is rejected
(winwrap is exception-free for library control flow).

*Note:* this would be winwrap's **first use of a WIL error macro** — deliberately,
because this is the one spot that is genuinely its sanctioned tier. If you'd rather
not pull `<wil/result_macros.h>` for a single macro, the std-only equivalent is
`if (status == get_message_failed) std::abort();` with a comment — but `FAIL_FAST_IF`
is the house-blessed spelling and survives release builds (unlike `assert`).

### 3. Accelerator tables (`TranslateAcceleratorW`) — leave room, don't build

**Do not build now; the free-function shape already leaves room.** No v0.1 app
(wifi-toggle) has an accelerator table, so per §3's *second-consumer* trigger it is
premature. The extension path is clean and non-breaking: a future defaulted config
overload

```cpp
struct RunConfig { HWND target{}; HACCEL accelerator{}; };   // §1 config struct
[[nodiscard]] inline int run(const RunConfig& cfg);          // additive overload
```

whose loop inserts `if (cfg.accelerator && TranslateAcceleratorW(cfg.target, cfg.accelerator, &msg)) continue;`
before `TranslateMessage`. Existing `winwrap::run()` callers are untouched (it stays,
or forwards to `run({})`). `TranslateAcceleratorW` needs the target `HWND`, which is
why the config carries a `target` — noted now so the eventual struct is right, built
later (conventions-early / abstractions-late).

### 4. Modeless dialogs (`IsDialogMessageW`) — leave room, don't build

**Same verdict, same door.** winwrap has no dialog wrapper today, so nothing can
produce a modeless dialog HWND to filter. When one exists, `IsDialogMessageW` slots
into the *same* `RunConfig` path (a dialog-HWND list, or a registration callback) —
again before `TranslateMessage`, again additive. Building it now would be guessing
the shape before a real consumer (§3). The one thing to preserve so it *can* be added:
keep `run()` a plain loop with no assumptions, which the recommended design does.

### 5. Interaction with the `Window<T>` lifecycle — the quit story

The loop ends on `WM_QUIT`, which only ever comes from `PostQuitMessage`. **winwrap
posts it nowhere today** — so a winwrap app currently has no way to exit its own
loop. The coherent, minimal story is that *the main window posts the quit when it is
destroyed*, via the existing `on_destroy` hook (routed by the built-in `Lifecycle`
mixin):

```cpp
struct MainWindow : winwrap::Window<MainWindow> {
    static constexpr const wchar_t* class_name = L"MainWindow";
    void on_destroy() { winwrap::quit(); }
};
```

Full path: user clicks ✕ → `WM_CLOSE` → `DefWindowProcW` → `DestroyWindow` →
`WM_DESTROY` → `Lifecycle` fires `on_destroy()` → `winwrap::quit()`
(`PostQuitMessage`) → `GetMessageW` returns `0` → `run()` returns `0`. This is honest and matches "you
write the `on_*` hooks you need": *which* window owns the app's lifetime is app
policy, not something the library should assume (a tray tool's message-only window
outlives every visible window; a tool window must **not** quit the app).

**Why not a `QuitOnDestroy` mixin:** it would have to claim `WM_DESTROY`, but a
mixin composes *after* the built-in `Lifecycle` (first-match-wins), so it would fire
only on windows that *don't* define `on_destroy` — the exact built-in-vs-extra
overlap footgun MIXINS.md warns against. A window that defines `on_destroy` for its
own cleanup would silently never quit. So the explicit one-liner is not just simpler,
it is *more correct* than a mixin here.

**Consistency flag (not a v0.1 blocker):** `DropZone` (the premade window) does
*not* quit on close, so running it as a top-level main window would hang. That's fine
for its intended use (a drop target inside a larger app), but if a premade
*main-window* convenience is ever built, that base is where the quit-on-destroy policy
belongs — bundled, opt-in, deferred per §3.

**Correction (as built): `winwrap::quit(int = 0)` *was* added.** The proposal
originally rejected it as a thin `PostQuitMessage` rename (per the LIBRARY_CONVENTIONS
thin-wrapper rule). That was wrong. The thin-wrapper rule targets renames that hide a
name the user still needs *and add nothing* — e.g. `DragQueryFileW`, whose sentinel +
length-probe protocol you must understand either way, so the fix there was a *class*
(`Drop`) that hides the protocol, not a rename. `quit()` is the opposite: it names
user *intent* over the `PostQuitMessage` *mechanism*, and the user never needs to know
the underlying call to use it. The deciding test — **"does the user need to understand
the underlying Win32 call?"** — is *no* for `quit()` (call it, the app exits; the arg
is the exit code) and *yes* for `DragQueryFileW`. So `quit()` is a sanctioned
ergonomic verb (VISION pillar 1) and the everyday user-facing exit call (an "Exit"
menu item, a tray "Quit"); `on_destroy` calls `winwrap::quit()`, not `PostQuitMessage`
directly. (This nuance is now codified in winwrap `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md`.)

### 6. Placement & naming — `winwrap/message_loop.hpp`, header-only

**New concept-named header `winwrap/message_loop.hpp`** (§3: "cross-cutting concerns
live in concept-named shared headers"). It joins the established `message_*` family
(`message_dispatcher.hpp`, `message_reflection.hpp`) and names the concept exactly.
The runner is genuinely cross-cutting — every GUI app uses it, it belongs to no
single wrapper — so it does not go in `window.hpp`.

**Header-only, `inline`, no `.cpp`.** The function is non-template and tiny; `inline`
gives it a single definition across translation units (the `error.hpp` precedent —
`inline last_error()`). `menu.cpp` / `notify_icon.cpp` exist because those are large
non-template *classes*, not because "non-template ⇒ `.cpp`"; a ~10-line loop stays
inline. It `#include "winwrap/win.hpp"` first (the mandated `<windows.h>` preamble),
then `<wil/result_macros.h>`.

### 7. Testing — Catch2 without a live UI

The pump blocks in `GetMessageW`, but `PostQuitMessage` / `PostMessageW` queue
messages on the **current thread** synchronously, so the loop can be driven and
observed headlessly on the test thread. Proposed `tests/message_loop_test.cpp`
(add to `tests/CMakeLists.txt`):

1. **`run()` returns the quit code immediately when WM_QUIT is already queued.**
   `PostQuitMessage(42); CHECK(winwrap::run() == 42);` — `GetMessageW` sees the
   pending `WM_QUIT`, returns `0` on the first call, `run()` returns `42`. No window,
   no blocking. Proves the return-value contract.

2. **`run()` dispatches queued messages to a real WndProc before quitting.** Create
   a message-only window (`Window` with `WindowConfig{.parent = HWND_MESSAGE}`) whose
   `on_command(id)` records the id; `PostMessageW(hwnd, WM_COMMAND, 7, 0)` then
   `PostQuitMessage(0)`; `run()`; assert the handler saw `7` **and** `run()` returned
   `0`. Exercises the full `GetMessage → Translate → Dispatch → WndProc →
   dispatch_message → on_command` path with no visible UI. (Mirrors how
   `file_droppable_test.cpp` drives dispatch, but through the real pump rather than
   calling `dispatch_message` directly.)

3. **`run()` drains multiple messages in FIFO order, then exits on WM_QUIT.** Post
   `WM_COMMAND` ids `1, 2, 3` to the message-only window, then `PostQuitMessage(0)`;
   assert the recorded ids are `{1,2,3}` (everything before `WM_QUIT` was delivered)
   and `run()` returned `0`. Confirms the loop pumps until quit, not just once.

*Test hygiene:* each test consumes its own `WM_QUIT` (the loop exits and the flag is
cleared), so tests don't leak queue state into each other; keep them in one TU. This
is the "Catch2 tests that exercise behaviour without a live message pump" ROADMAP
item — turned inside out: we *do* run the pump, but headlessly and deterministically.

### 8. YAGNI — what is deliberately NOT built now

Per §3 (no second consumer yet; wifi-toggle needs only a bare pump) and VISION (not
a framework), the MVP is the free function + fail-fast and nothing else. Explicitly
deferred, each additive-without-a-break behind the free-function / `RunConfig` door:

- **Accelerator tables** (Q3) — no app has one.
- **Modeless-dialog `IsDialogMessageW`** (Q4) — no dialog wrapper exists.
- **`PeekMessage` idle / game-loop variant + `OnIdle` chain** (WTL/Win32++) — no
  continuous-render or background-work consumer; the blocking `GetMessage` pump is
  correct and power-friendly for event-driven desktop tools.
- **`PreTranslateMessage` filter chains** (WTL/Win32++) — machinery for routing
  accel/dialog across many windows; solves a problem winwrap doesn't have.
- **An `Application` / `CWinApp` singleton** owning `HINSTANCE`/`nShowCmd` — the
  window already owns both; the object would be stateless ceremony.
- **Nested / modal message loops** (`DialogBox`-style) — out of scope until a modal
  dialog wrapper exists.

## (e) Chosen header + placement (summary)

- **File:** `lib/include/winwrap/message_loop.hpp` (new).
- **Symbol:** `winwrap::run()` → `int`, `[[nodiscard]]`, `inline`, header-only.
- **Includes:** `"winwrap/win.hpp"` first, then `<wil/result_macros.h>`.
- **No `.cpp`.** No change to any existing header (purely additive).

## (f) Catch2 test plan (summary)

New `tests/message_loop_test.cpp`, three cases (Q7): (1) pre-queued `WM_QUIT` →
`run()` returns its code; (2) posted `WM_COMMAND` to a message-only window is
dispatched to `on_command` before quit; (3) FIFO drain of several messages then
quit. Register the file in `tests/CMakeLists.txt`'s `add_executable(winwrap_test …)`
list.

## (g) Step-by-step implementation plan (you write it) — ✅ done (2026-07-13)

> Completed as described, with the two deltas in *Status* above (`quit()` added;
> sentinel named `message_failed_code`) and a fourth test (close → exit). Steps 3/5
> below use `winwrap::quit()` rather than a raw `PostQuitMessage(0)`.

1. **Create the header.** `lib/include/winwrap/message_loop.hpp` — `#pragma once`,
   `#include "winwrap/win.hpp"`, then `#include <wil/result_macros.h>`, `namespace
   winwrap {`. Write the Doxygen `///` brief + `@return`/`@note` on `run()` (public
   API ⇒ documented, per `cpp:style`).
2. **Write `run()`.** Match the sketch in (c): the `constexpr int get_message_failed
   {-1};` named constant (no bare `-1` at the call site, per "named constexpr at its
   contextual boundary" — function-local, its only user), the `while ((status =
   GetMessageW(...)) != 0)` loop with braces (multi-statement body), `FAIL_FAST_IF`,
   `TranslateMessage` + `DispatchMessageW`, and `return static_cast<int>(msg.wParam)`.
   Decide fail-fast vs the std-only `abort` fallback from Q2.
3. **Give a window a way to quit.** In your exercise/main window add
   `void on_destroy() { PostQuitMessage(0); }` (Q5). This is the piece that makes the
   loop terminable.
4. **Wire the call site.** Replace the hand-rolled loop in `hello-window`'s (or
   wifi-toggle's) `wWinMain` with `return winwrap::run();` per (c). Confirm the app
   still opens and — the new part — *closes cleanly* (✕ exits the process, no hang).
5. **Add the tests.** Write `tests/message_loop_test.cpp` with the three cases from
   (f); add it to `tests/CMakeLists.txt`. For cases 2–3, reuse the message-only-window
   fixture idea (`WindowConfig{.parent = HWND_MESSAGE}`) and record ids in an
   `on_command`.
6. **Build & verify (MSVC is ground truth).** Configure + build the `dev` preset,
   run `winwrap_test`; expect all green. Then eyeball the running app for the
   open-and-close-cleanly behaviour from step 4 (the pump can't be fully judged by
   tests alone).
7. **Update the docs.** Tick ROADMAP → *wifi-toggle readiness gaps* §3 (message loop)
   as done and note the header; add `run()` to any public-API listing. Leave the
   accelerator/modeless/`RunConfig` extension notes recorded as future-additive so the
   door stays documented.
```
