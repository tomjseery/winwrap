# winwrap — roadmap

What's done, what's next, and the spec for each piece. Design rationale lives in
[VISION.md](VISION.md).

## Next session: prepare the correctness plan

The [technical and product assessment](ASSESSMENT.md) reassesses the actual source,
tests, install consumption and current ecosystem. It proposes an application-driven
roadmap through v1.0. The author has since clarified the wrapper-first API direction
and learning purpose; their owners are [CODE_CONVENTIONS.md](CODE_CONVENTIONS.md#4-wrapper-first-apis--abstract-the-operation-preserve-the-escape-hatch)
and [VISION.md](VISION.md#why-it-exists). Other assessment proposals are not
automatically locked decisions.

Before resuming feature breadth, resolve the high-severity library findings indexed
by [TECH_DEBT.md](TECH_DEBT.md), then prove the current tray/control slice in an
application. The assessment's **Next five milestones** and **Application-driven
roadmap** are the proposed sequencing to reconcile with the backlog below.
No runtime fixes or new controls were implemented by the assessment or this
planning preparation. [PLANNING.md](PLANNING.md) owns the readiness map and open
questions to resolve before an implementation-ready plan and ledger are written.

### Proposed workstreams

These stable keys identify candidates for later plans; no implementation plan or
delivery ledger exists yet. The order is a release-hardening proposal, not a
permanent limit on desktop coverage.

- [ ] `winwrap/correctness-foundation` — reliable binding, ownership, failures,
  message results and focused regression tests; prepare this plan first.
- [ ] `winwrap/tray-utility` — a complete tray application and the wrapper operations
  it needs, including icon changes, timer lifetime and recovery.
- [ ] `winwrap/settings-and-consumption` — native settings, keyboard/focus/DPI,
  supported build/install checks and documented application deployment.
- [ ] `winwrap/richer-desktop` — dialogs, accelerators, richer notifications and
  native controls driven by a multi-window application.
- [ ] `winwrap/public-stability` — external consumption, compatibility, distribution
  and sustained release evidence.

## Existing application backlog and specifications

> **The road to v0.1 is now a punch list: [`PRE_V01_PROMPTS.md`](PRE_V01_PROMPTS.md)**
> — historical session briefs (5 structural, 3 additive). Reconcile them with the
> assessment and current debt before execution; they are not standing guidance.

**Goal: an MVP usable in wifi-toggle** = `Window` ✓ + `Menu` ✓ + `NotifyIcon`,
composing through the `on_*` hooks. Earlier decisions remain recorded below, but
the assessment's reproduced correctness issues qualify their readiness claims.

> **v0.2 `Control<T>` is ✅ done** — implemented + MSVC-verified (compiles + links via
> `control_test`), though not yet exercised on screen. Next: a control-on-screen
> exercise app, then the v0.1 app track below.

1. ~~`hello-window` example~~ — ✅ **Done & runs on screen.**
   `MainWindow : public Window<MainWindow>` + `wWinMain` + message loop. It's a
   **standalone project** at `cpp/windows/hello-window` (scaffolded with
   `newcpp -Windows`), *not* an `examples/` subdir; it pulls winwrap's headers via a
   local include path (`Window` is header-only). Currently uncommitted (throwaway).
2. ~~Task 2 — `Menu`~~ — ✅ **Done** (see Task 2 below).
3. ~~Task 3 — `NotifyIcon`~~ — ✅ **Done** (implemented; not yet exercised — see Task 3).
4. **Wire into wifi-toggle** — swap its hand-rolled Win32 for winwrap. This is
   also the first on-screen exercise of `NotifyIcon` + `Menu` (the earlier
   standalone `tray_app` step is dropped — wifi-toggle *is* the exercise app). ← **next**
5. **Tag `v0.1`** — so wifi-toggle pins a tag (no surprise BC).

### wifi-toggle readiness gaps (2026-07-12 comparison vs WinLamb / Win32++ / WTL / WIL)

Close these before or while wiring — wifi-toggle needs each one:

1. **`NotifyIcon::set_icon`** *(blocking — the status recolor is the app's core
   feature)*. `NIM_MODIFY` with `uFlags = NIF_ICON`; identity = the original
   `(hWnd, uID)` from `NIM_ADD`; the shell does **not** take ownership of the
   `HICON`, so swap the owned `wil::unique_hicon` member only after the call
   succeeds. No `NIM_SETVERSION` re-send needed after a modify.
2. **`on_timer(id)` hook** — a `Timable` mixin (`WM_TIMER`, id = `wparam`) per the
   `MIXINS.md` recipe, for the status poll. Precedent: WTL's `MSG_WM_TIMER` →
   `OnTimer(UINT_PTR)`; no surveyed library wraps `SetTimer`/`KillTimer` beyond
   raw members. Plan a Winwrap timer API with explicit ownership/cancellation;
   direct calls can establish the protocol during learning, not stand in for
   completed timer coverage in the final supported application slice.
3. ~~**Message loop**~~ — ✅ **Done (2026-07-13).** `winwrap/message_loop.hpp`:
   header-only `run()` (the `GetMessageW`/`TranslateMessage`/`DispatchMessageW` pump;
   returns `msg.wParam`; `-1` guarded by `FAIL_FAST_IF`) + `quit(int = 0)` (over
   `PostQuitMessage`). A window exits the app via `on_destroy` → `winwrap::quit()`.
   Four Catch2 tests (pre-queued quit / dispatch-to-window / FIFO drain / close→exit),
   MSVC-clean. Accelerators / modeless-dialog / idle handling stay deferred behind a
   future `RunConfig` overload (WinLamb `RUN()`, Win32++ `CWinApp::Run`, WTL
   `CMessageLoop` precedents) — additive, not built now. Design: `MESSAGE_LOOP_DESIGN.md`.
4. ~~**Per-item menu callbacks**~~ — ✅ **Done (2026-07-12).** `add_item(text,
   handler)` + `TPM_RETURNCMD` show; see *Decisions locked → Menu routing
   (revised)*. Remaining acceptance check (from the design task): the wifi-toggle
   window ends up with zero menu ids, zero `switch`, zero `on_command`.

`NotifyIcon` targets v4 and exposes a re-add operation; this is not proof of
automatic Explorer-restart recovery or superiority to every alternative. The
assessment owns current competitor evidence. Drawing a status `HICON` remains
app-side GDI (`CreateIconIndirect`); adoption must have an explicit ownership contract.

## Current state (v0.1)

- **`Window<T>`** — ✅ **Done & exercised.** Configurable `create(WindowConfig)`,
  two-layer registration/creation, `std::expected` error model, `configure_class`
  hook, `WM_NCDESTROY` lifetime fix, a **`show(cmd)`** convenience, and **compile-time
  `on_*` message hooks** (see *Decisions locked → Message dispatch*). Runs on screen
  via `hello-window`. Builds clean (MSVC `/W4`), clang-tidy-clean, Doxygen-documented.
- **`Menu`** — ✅ **Done.** `class Menu final`; `create()` factory →
  `std::expected<Menu, std::error_code>`; `add_item(id, text)` /
  `add_item(text, handler)` / `show` / `handle()`; owns its `HMENU` via
  `wil::unique_hmenu` (move-only). `show` (`TPM_RETURNCMD`) fires a handler item's
  callback directly; an id item is re-posted as `WM_COMMAND` → owner's
  `on_command`. Builds clean, tests pass.
- **`NotifyIcon`** — ✅ **Done.** Move-only RAII wrapper over `Shell_NotifyIcon`,
  targeting `NOTIFYICON_VERSION_4`. `create(NotifyIconConfig)` → `std::expected`;
  `add()` (initial add + `WM_TASKBARCREATED` re-add), `set_tooltip`, static
  `taskbar_created_message()`; owns `HICON` via `wil::unique_hicon`; `NIM_DELETE` on
  destruct; hand-written Rule-of-Five (the shell registration isn't an RAII handle).
  Builds clean (`/W4` + sanitizers), clang-tidy-clean. **Not yet exercised** by an app.
- **`error.hpp`** — `last_error()` lives in `winwrap/error.hpp` (shared by
  `window.hpp` and `menu.cpp`).
- **`message_loop.hpp`** — ✅ **Done (2026-07-13).** Header-only `run()` (the message
  pump; returns `msg.wParam`; `-1` → `FAIL_FAST_IF`) + `quit(int = 0)` (over
  `PostQuitMessage`). App exits via `on_destroy` → `winwrap::quit()`. Four Catch2 tests,
  MSVC-clean. Design/rationale: `MESSAGE_LOOP_DESIGN.md`.
- **Build** — CMake + WIL + install/export + warnings/sanitizers exist. A full-install
  consumer passed in the assessment; explicit dependency metadata, compiler CI and
  additional consumer configurations remain release work.

## Decisions locked

- **Build our own CRTP window bridge** — not ATL `CWindowImpl`. (See VISION → the
  reuse rule.)
- **Window config via a `WindowConfig` struct** + C++20 designated initializers —
  not a builder, not static traits. Drops the variadic/forwarding from `create()`.
- **Config-struct factories (generalised):** any public factory with multiple args
  (or any two same-typed args) takes a `*Config` struct + designated initializers —
  `NotifyIconConfig` joins `WindowConfig`. Codified in `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md` (winwrap);
  the struct-doc style lives in `cpp-standards:cpp-style` (all projects).
- **Errors as `std::expected<T, std::error_code>`** at the public API; Win32 codes
  via `std::system_category()`. WIL stays for RAII handles only, not control flow.
- **Message dispatch via composable compile-time mixins** (`mixins.hpp` +
  `message_reflection.hpp` + `message_dispatcher.hpp`); respelled from CRTP to
  C++23 **deducing this** on 2026-07-12 (see *Dispatch design review* below) —
  mixins are plain structs whose `handle_message` deduces the final type through an
  explicit object parameter (`this auto& self`).
  Seven empty-base mixins — `Lifecycle`, `Sizable`, `Commandable`, `Paintable`,
  `MouseInput`, `KeyboardInput`, `FocusAware` — each expose
  `std::optional<LRESULT> handle_message(UINT, WPARAM, LPARAM)`: engaged = handled,
  `nullopt` = pass on. `MessageDispatcher<Mixins...>` chains them via a fold
  expression (`||`), short-circuiting on first match, and its `dispatch_message`
  falls back to the derived type's `default_proc` when no mixin claims the
  message. Both `Window<T>` and `Control<T>` inherit it. The `WW_CASE(message, call)` macro (defined + `#undef`'d inside
  `mixins.hpp`) is the only tool that can simultaneously put a maybe-absent member
  into an unevaluated `requires` and `return`/`break` from the caller's frame — one
  line per case, zero duplication. No vtables; composition is compile-time but
  message matching is runtime. Derived
  types define only the **public** `on_*` hooks they need. `dispatch_message` stays
  **shadowable** as the escape hatch for runtime-id messages (e.g. the tray
  callback) — delegate the rest with `Window::dispatch_message`.
- **Dispatch design review (2026-07-12): held.** Stress-tested against seven
  alternatives — ATL/WTL macro maps, virtual `WndProc` (Win32++), runtime lambda
  registries (WinLamb), signal/slot (LFWin32), `constexpr` message tables,
  concepts-hardening, and a C++23 deducing-this respelling. Why it held: every
  design that fixes silent hook misses does it by **explicit registration** (a
  macro-map entry, a table row, an `on_message` call) — that trades the
  "define `on_paint` and it fires" zero-boilerplate property for a second list to
  maintain, and the silent miss just moves into that list (a forgotten entry
  misses identically). Virtual `WndProc` fixes misses via `override` but fixes
  the *interface*: every hook is a vtable slot whether used or not, per-message
  typed signatures don't fit, and absent handlers can't compile out. No
  alternative catches the real overlap hazard either — the `WM_COMMAND` lparam
  split is value-based, invisible to any msg-id-keyed static check. Runtime
  honesty (README ammo): one vtable call per message is unmeasurable next to
  message-delivery cost; the zero-cost win is interface and codegen — EBO,
  typed hooks, dead branches eliminated — not cycles saved.
  Follow-ups:
  - **(a) Additive, recommended — hook-signature hardening.** Extend the macro to
    `WW_CASE(message, hook, call)`; in the `if constexpr` *else* branch add
    `static_assert(!requires { &std::remove_cvref_t<decltype(self)>::hook; },
    "winwrap: '" #hook "' exists but doesn't match the hook signature")` (the
    final type is spelled from `self` now that no `Derived` parameter exists).
    A member *named* like the hook whose
    signature doesn't match becomes a compile error instead of a silent no-fire.
    `Commandable` (macro-free) gets the same assert by hand. Limits: pure-typo
    hooks (`on_pain`) still need the synthetic-message Catch2 tests (TECH_DEBT);
    an overloaded hook name evades the check (acceptable edge).
  - **(b) ✅ DONE (2026-07-12) — deducing-this respelling (P0847, MSVC since
    VS 17.4).** Same architecture, simpler spelling at identical codegen: mixins
    lost `<Derived>` and the `static_cast`s, `Clickable`/`TextChangeable` lost
    their dummy template params, `MessageHandler`/`Window`/`Control` lost the
    `template <typename> typename...` template-template params;
    `handle_message(this auto& self, ...)` deduces the final type at the call
    site. Accepted cost: the engine's language floor rose from C++20 to C++23
    (the deferred C++17 backport would need a dispatch rework either way —
    `requires` already ruled out C++17). Built delivery-mode by Claude; verified:
    clean MSVC `/W4` + ASan build, 16/16 tests pass.
    **MSVC gotcha (C7515):** the fold can't expand the pack inside a qualified
    member access (`self.Mixins::handle_message(...)`) — worked around via a private
    static `handle_message<Mixin>(self, ...)` helper (same name, deliberately), which
    expands the pack as a template argument instead. GCC/Clang accept the direct
    form; keep the helper for MSVC.
    **Naming (settled 2026-07-12, fresh-eyes review):** engine = `MessageDispatcher`
    in `message_dispatcher.hpp`, entry = `dispatch_message`, mixin member =
    `handle_message`, shared match-and-fire = `handle_notification` — dispatchers
    dispatch, handlers handle (Reactor vocabulary — ACE's `handle_*` members;
    Win32's own `DispatchMessage`). One change from the provisional scheme: the
    mixin member was bare `handle`, which gained the `_message` suffix — in a
    Win32 wrapper `handle` is the domain's loaded *noun* (`Menu::handle()` is
    already the raw-`HMENU` accessor, and an eventual `WindowHandle::handle()`
    would collide on the very objects that carry the mixin member), and the
    suffix restores the verb+object symmetry of its two siblings. *Probed on our toolchain (2026-07-12,
    MSVC 2022 BuildTools `/std:c++latest`): a prototype engine compiles and
    dispatches correctly, with one wart — MSVC rejects the pack in
    `self.Mixins::dispatch(...)` directly inside a fold (C7515); a small private
    `try_one<Mixin>` helper restores it. Budget for that helper if adopted.*
  - **(c) Empirical layout note (probed 2026-07-12).** "Empty mixins → zero
    size" is false on MSVC by default: only the *first* empty base is folded
    away, so the 8-mixin list costs +8 bytes per window (measured 24 vs 16 with
    `__declspec(empty_bases)` on `MessageDispatcher`). Harmless at our scale;
    recorded in TECH_DEBT (fix or soften the mixins.hpp doc comment).
- **Class-level config** (the `WNDCLASS`) is customized by a `configure_class`
  hook the derived type shadows — same CRTP mechanism as the `on_*` dispatch.
- **Doc comments:** Doxygen `///` + `@`-commands on the **public API** only;
  one-line `if` bodies drop braces. (Both codified in `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md`.)
- **Lint carve-outs** (`.clang-tidy`): `#pragma once` allowed; `reinterpret-cast`
  and `int-to-ptr` allowed (inherent to native Win32). The `-Windows` variant also
  disables `convert-member-functions-to-static` (the `on_*` hooks are instance
  methods by contract) and `named-parameter` (unused Win32 callback / entry-point
  params stay unnamed, else MSVC `/W4 C4100` fires). All propagated to `newcpp.ps1`.
  winwrap's `.clang-tidy` further disables `pro-type-union-access` (SDK anonymous
  unions, e.g. `NOTIFYICONDATAW.uVersion`) and `easily-swappable-parameters` (Win32
  passes adjacent same-typed scalars pervasively) — candidates to propagate.
  **Lint triage policy** (in `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md`): the compiler is the source of
  truth — suppress a check if it's wrong/inapplicable (with a comment why), else fix
  the code.

### Tray / menu integration (locked Stage-0, governs Tasks 2–3)

- **Tray model:** `NotifyIcon` **attaches to a `Window<T>` you own** — takes the
  owner's `HWND` + a callback message id; tray events arrive at that window's
  `handle_message`. *Not* a self-contained callback object — one event path, no
  parallel `std::function` layer. A `TrayApp` convenience bundle can be added later,
  additively.
- **Menu routing (revised 2026-07-12 — supersedes the posted-`WM_COMMAND`-only
  design):** menu items take **per-item callbacks** — `add_item(text, handler)`
  auto-assigns an internal id (from `0xE000` up) and stores the handler inside the
  `Menu`; `show` uses `TPM_RETURNCMD` and fires the picked item's handler directly,
  so the id machinery is invisible library plumbing (like control-notification ids).
  **Escape hatch:** the legacy `add_item(id, text)` overload stays; a picked id with
  no stored handler is re-posted as `WM_COMMAND` to the owner → `on_command(id)` via
  `Commandable` — legacy menus, mixed menus, and accelerators behave exactly as
  before. Per item there is exactly one route, chosen by which overload added it.
  User-chosen ids must stay below `0xE000`; on a collision the callback wins.
- **Tray events exposed raw** (you `switch` on the callback message in
  `dispatch_message`) for the MVP. A typed `TrayEvent` enum is a future *additive*
  layer, not a v1 requirement.
- **Target `NOTIFYICON_VERSION_4`** from the start (richer event protocol; GUID
  identity requires separate `NIF_GUID` support and is not enabled by v4 alone).
  Changing the protocol later would be a BC break — do it now.
- **Tray recovery needs a broadcast receiver:** use a hidden top-level window, or
  forward from one to a message-only host. `HWND_MESSAGE` alone does not receive
  `TaskbarCreated`; see the platform evidence in the assessment.
- **Composition & lifetime:** `NotifyIcon` and `Menu` are **members of the derived
  window**, initialized in `on_created()` (where `hwnd()` is valid). Their lifetime
  = the window's.
- **Window dependencies** (e.g. wifi-toggle's controller): inject via members /
  `on_created()` for now (`T` stays default-constructible). A ctor-arg-forwarding
  `create` overload is **additive** later — not a BC break.

---

## Task 1 — `Window<T>`: configurability + lifetime + error model — ✅ DONE

Delivered in `lib/include/winwrap/window.hpp`: `WindowConfig` struct; `create()`
returning `std::expected<std::unique_ptr<T>, std::error_code>`; two-layer
registration/creation; `last_error()` helper; `RegisterClassW`/`CreateWindowExW`
error propagation (tolerating `ERROR_CLASS_ALREADY_EXISTS`); `configure_class`
hook; `WM_NCDESTROY` lifetime fix (no dangling `hwnd_`). Verified: builds clean,
clang-tidy-clean, Doxygen-documented.

**Remaining to fully close the original "done when":** exercise it with a running
app — `examples/hello_window` (see *Next session*). The window code is finished;
it just hasn't been shown on screen yet.

## Task 2 — `Menu` — ✅ DONE

Delivered in `lib/include/winwrap/menu.hpp` + `lib/src/menu.cpp`:
- **`class Menu final`** — sealed, move-only (owns `HMENU` via `wil::unique_hmenu`).
- **`create()`** — static factory → `std::expected<Menu, std::error_code>`, wraps
  `CreatePopupMenu` (null → `last_error()`); private ctor adopts the handle.
- **`add_item(UINT id, const wchar_t* text)`** → `AppendMenuW(..., MF_STRING, ...)`,
  returns `std::expected<void, std::error_code>`.
- **`show(HWND owner)`** → `SetForegroundWindow` + `GetCursorPos` +
  `TrackPopupMenuEx` (no `TPM_RETURNCMD`) + `PostMessageW(owner, WM_NULL, 0, 0)`
  (both `TrackPopupMenu` gotchas).
- **`handle()`** — non-owning `HMENU` accessor (escape hatch).
- **Click routing (revised + implemented 2026-07-12):** per-item callbacks fired
  from `show` via `TPM_RETURNCMD` (see *Decisions locked → Menu routing*); the
  legacy `add_item(id, text)` → posted `WM_COMMAND` → `on_command(id)` path
  remains. Handlers live in an id-keyed `std::unordered_map` — robust to future
  `remove_item`/`insert_item` (a vector-by-index store was tried and reverted:
  it silently depended on ids staying dense and append-only). Lookup uses the
  `find`/`end()` idiom; a `try_find` wrapper is a future nicety (see TECH_DEBT).

Builds clean, clang-tidy-clean. **Not yet exercised** by an example — wire a `Menu`
into a window (right-click → `show()` → `on_command`); wifi-toggle will cover it.

## Task 3 — `NotifyIcon`: the differentiator — ✅ DONE

Delivered in `lib/include/winwrap/notify_icon.hpp` + `lib/src/notify_icon.cpp`:
- **`class NotifyIcon final`** — move-only; **hand-written Rule-of-Five** (the shell
  registration is keyed by `(hWnd, uID)`, not an RAII handle — moves neuter the
  source, the destructor runs `NIM_DELETE`). Owns the `HICON` via `wil::unique_hicon`.
- **`create(const NotifyIconConfig&)`** → `std::expected`; constructs then `add()`s,
  with RAII cleanup if `NIM_SETVERSION` fails after `NIM_ADD`.
- **`add()`** — `NIM_ADD` + `NIM_SETVERSION` (→ `NOTIFYICON_VERSION_4`); reused for the
  `WM_TASKBARCREATED` re-add. **`set_tooltip`** → `NIM_MODIFY`. Static
  **`taskbar_created_message()`** → `RegisterWindowMessageW`.
- **`NotifyIconConfig`** struct + designated initializers (kills swappable
  same-typed params; mirrors `WindowConfig`).
- Builds clean (`/W4` + sanitizers), clang-tidy-clean.
- **Not yet exercised** — wifi-toggle will wire it into a window's `handle_message`
  (decode the v4 event from `LOWORD(lParam)`) + a `Menu`.

**LOCKED design:** attaches to a `Window<T>` (takes its `HWND` + callback message
id); lives as a member of the derived window, created in `on_created()`; targets
`NOTIFYICON_VERSION_4`.

1. **`NOTIFYICONDATAW`** + `Shell_NotifyIcon(NIM_ADD / NIM_MODIFY / NIM_DELETE)`,
   `NIM_SETVERSION` → `NOTIFYICON_VERSION_4`. RAII: `NIM_DELETE` on destruction.
2. **`uCallbackMessage`** = an app message (e.g. `WM_APP + n`) wired to the owner
   window — tray events arrive at the owner's `handle_message` (raw for MVP).
3. **`wil::unique_hicon`** owns the icon.
4. **`WM_TASKBARCREATED` resurrection** — re-add the icon if Explorer restarts
   (the robustness trick `CTrayNotifyIcon` had).
5. Value-based errors: a `NotifyIcon::create(...)` **factory** returning
   `std::expected<…, std::error_code>` (construction can fail → factory, not ctor).

---

## Post-v0.1 roadmap

Once v0.1 ships (Window + Menu + NotifyIcon, wired into wifi-toggle and tagged),
here's the planned order. **None of this blocks v0.1.**

### Coverage gaps (2026-07-30 survey vs WinLamb / Win32++ / WTL)

A second library comparison, this one asking "what building block is missing?" rather
than the 2026-07-12 one's "what does wifi-toggle need?". Checked against the full
contents of `lib/include/winwrap/`, not a name scan. Feeds the v0.2 / v0.3 sections
below; nothing here is a new pillar.

**The finding: the sharpest gaps are holes inside wrappers already shipped, not
missing wrappers.** In priority order:

1. **Painting protocol — `on_paint()` hands the user nothing** *(shape to reassess)*.
   `Paintable` fires `self.on_paint()` with no DC, and the library contains no
   `BeginPaint` adapter. WIL already supplies `wil::BeginPaint`,
   `wil::unique_hdc_paint` and selection guards. Use those first; a proposed
   `on_paint(PaintDc&)` needs to add a useful context/protocol contract, not duplicate
   cleanup. The current hook does not automatically validate the update region.
2. **`WM_NOTIFY` reflection — an engine gap, not a control gap.**
   `message_reflection.hpp` already says "`WM_NOTIFY` joins here when it lands."
   ListView, TreeView, Tab and DateTimePicker use this protocol; a parent can handle
   it directly before reflection exists. Trackbars primarily use `WM_HSCROLL` /
   `WM_VSCROLL`. Prioritize coherent reflection before broadening the catalog. Trips the
   `return 0` ceiling recorded in TECH_DEBT — resolve that at the same time.
3. **Right-click hooks — the missing half of `Menu`.** `MouseInput` covers
   `WM_MOUSEMOVE` / `WM_LBUTTONDOWN` / `WM_LBUTTONUP` only, so a window that owns a
   context `Menu` can't detect the click that should show it. Add `on_rbutton_down` /
   `on_rbutton_up` (and consider `WM_CONTEXTMENU`, which also covers the keyboard menu
   key). *Not* a v0.1 blocker: the tray path delivers `WM_CONTEXTMENU` through
   `NotifyIcon`'s callback message, not through `MouseInput`.
4. **UTF-8 ↔ UTF-16 conversion is absent.** No `MultiByteToWideChar` /
   `WideCharToMultiByte` anywhere in `include/` or `src/`. The house style mandates
   UTF-8 core / UTF-16 boundary and the whole API takes `const wchar_t*`, yet the
   library gives callers no way to cross that boundary. `std::codecvt` is deprecated
   and WIL has no converter, so this is a legitimate roll-your-own (WinLamb ships
   `str.h` for it). Precedent for the home: a concept-named shared header per §3.
5. Smaller holes in the same class: **`InitCommonControlsEx` is never called** (fine
   for the current BUTTON/EDIT/COMBOBOX — user32 classes — but ProgressBar / ListView
   / StatusBar will fail to create); **`WindowHandle` lacks** `client_rect`, `move`,
   `invalidate`, `focus`, `destroy`, `set_font`, `dpi`; **`Menu` has no** separator,
   submenu, check/enable, or menu bar.

**New wrappers worth building**, ranked, all of them building blocks rather than
features:

| Thing | Survey evidence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Common dialogs — `IFileOpenDialog`, folder picker, `TaskDialogIndirect` | WinLamb `sysdlg.h`, Win32++ `CFileDialog`/`CTaskDialog`, WTL `atldlgs.h` | **build** — best value-per-line on the list: fallible → `std::expected`, `*Config` struct, needs no window framework |
| `Timable` mixin + `SetTimer`/`KillTimer` RAII | WTL `MSG_WM_TIMER` | **build** — already listed as a wifi-toggle gap above |
| `load_icon` helper (`LoadImageW` / `LoadIconMetric`) | WinLamb `icon.h` | **build** — `NotifyIcon` currently demands a caller-made `HICON`; every tray app needs this |
| `Point` / `Size` / `Rect` value types | Win32++ `CRect`, WTL `atlmisc.h` | **build, small** — hooks pass raw `int x, int y` / `WORD w, h` today |
| `on_dpi_changed` mixin (`WM_DPICHANGED`) | Win32++ explicitly advertises PMv2 support; age is not evidence of missing DPI support | **application-driven** — correct payload/result handling and app-owned awareness/layout policy, not a novelty claim |
| Label (STATIC), ListBox, ProgressBar, RadioButton | all three | **build after** items 2 and 5 above — these four need no `WM_NOTIFY` |
| ListView / TreeView / Tab / StatusBar | all three | **defer** — gated on `WM_NOTIFY`, and each is a large surface (WinLamb spends four internal headers on ListView alone) |
| `ITaskbarList3` progress over `shell.hpp` | WinLamb `progress_taskbar.h` | **later** — §3 reserved `shell.hpp` for this, and as of 2026-07-30 that header exists, so the home is real |

**Explicitly not building** — recorded so it isn't relitigated. These appear across the
surveyed libraries because they predate modern C++ / WIL, not because winwrap needs them:

- Files, registry, memory-mapped files (`CFile`, `CRegKey`, WinLamb
  `file.h`/`file_ini.h`/`file_mapped.h`) → `wil::unique_hfile`, `wil::unique_hkey`,
  `wil::reg`, `std::filesystem`. (`fs.hpp` is not a counterexample — it wraps bare
  selected intent/error protocols, not a prohibition on raw calls.)
- Strings and time (`CString`, `CTime`) → `std::wstring`, `std::chrono`.
- Threads and synchronisation (`CWinThread`, `CCriticalSection`, `CEvent`, `CMutex`) →
  `std::thread`, `std::mutex`, `std::condition_variable`.
- COM plumbing (`com_ptr`, `com_bstr`, `com_variant`) → `wil::com_ptr`.
- WinLamb's wider facilities — `zip.h`, `xml.h`, `download.h`, `version.h`, sockets.
  These are outside Winwrap's intended desktop-boundary concern.
- MDI, docking, ribbon, splitters, scroll views, property sheets, printing, themes —
  the framework side of the VISION line.
- **Native resizing helper** — reopen deliberately using the assessment's boundary:
  explicit HWND geometry/anchors are not the same responsibility as a full layout
  engine. No helper is scheduled until a real settings window demonstrates the need.

**Open scope question — resource-template dialogs.** WinLamb devotes four headers to
them (`dialog_main` / `dialog_modal` / `dialog_modeless` / `dialog_control`); Win32++
and WTL both make `CDialog` a peer of `CWnd`. It's a genuine second lifecycle —
`.rc` templates, `DialogBoxParamW`, `WM_INITDIALOG` instead of `WM_NCCREATE`,
`DWLP_USER` instead of `GWLP_USERDATA`, plus a `RunConfig` loop change for modeless —
so it's a `Dialog<T>` sibling to `Window<T>`, not an addition. Declining it is
defensible for a code-first library, but it's the one place we'd diverge from all
three surveyed libraries, so **decide it deliberately** rather than by omission.

### v0.2 — Controls (`Control<T>` — the CRTP control base)

> **✅ `Control<T>` done** (2026-06-28) — implemented + MSVC-verified (compiles + links
> via `tests/control_test.cpp`). Remaining: exercise it on screen.

> **Not gated behind v0.1.** Controls is library work, independent of the v0.1 app
> track (wifi-toggle → tag): no shared code, nothing extra to link, so
> it can be built first. Order by priority, not dependency.

The headline post-MVP feature: `Control<T>`, a CRTP base for native child controls
that you **subclass to customise**, mirroring `Window<T>`. A control is just a
`WS_CHILD` window of an OS class (`"BUTTON"`, `"EDIT"`, …) — Windows supplies the
widget; `Control<T>` supplies the same compile-time `on_*` dispatch as `Window<T>`.

- **`Control<T>` CRTP base** — derive a control type
  (`class MyButton : public Control<MyButton>`), shadow compile-time `on_*` hooks
  (`on_paint`, mouse, key, focus), dispatched via `if constexpr` — the `Window<T>`
  pattern. The bridge into the system control's message stream is
  **`SetWindowSubclass`** (the OS owns the control's WndProc); unhandled →
  `DefSubclassProc`. `this` rides in the subclass `dwRefData`, **not**
  `GWLP_USERDATA`.
- **Subclass-to-customise / owner-draw IS the point.** This supersedes the earlier
  *runtime-callback* design (thin `Button` instances + a `CommandRouter` + a
  `Window<T>` routing edit) — **rejected**: no `CommandRouter`, no edit to
  `window.hpp`.
- **Click semantics:** a control's `BN_CLICKED` arrives at the **parent** as
  `WM_COMMAND`. ~~Click-on-the-control-object (message reflection) is a future
  *additive* layer.~~ **✅ Built (2026-06-30):** the parent's `Reflecting` mixin now
  bounces the notification back down to the control (`wm_command_reflect`), where the
  control's own mixin fires the callback. Menu / accelerator commands
  (`lparam == 0`) still go to the window's `on_command(id)` via `Commandable`.
- **Lifetime** mirrors `Window<T>`: non-movable, `create()` →
  `std::expected<std::unique_ptr<T>, std::error_code>`, held as a `unique_ptr`
  member of the owner window; the parent destroys the child HWND (no
  `DestroyWindow`); the dtor / `WM_NCDESTROY` just `RemoveWindowSubclass`.
- **`Control<T>` + a mixin-composed control catalog (revised 2026-06-30).** The
  earlier "no pre-built controls, extract only reactively" stance is **superseded.**
  `Control<T>` stays the base, but the library now *does* ship concrete `final`
  controls, each composing the **notification mixins** it emits:
    - `Button` / `Checkbox` → `Clickable` (BN_CLICKED)
    - `Edit` → `TextChangeable` (EN_CHANGE)
    - `ComboBox` → `SelectionChangeable` (CBN_SELCHANGE)
  A mixin is one file under `mixins/`; a control is one file under `controls/`;
  the engine (`message_reflection.hpp` / `message_handler.hpp`) never changes as either grows. See
  `MIXINS.md` for the recipe. This is still **thin shells over native controls** —
  not a widget toolkit; the hard boundary below (no layout / theming) is unchanged.

**Hard boundary:** native controls + the subclass building block *only* — no layout
engine, no theming framework, no widget toolkit. Not a Qt/wxWidgets replacement.
(Owner-draw via subclassing **is** in scope now — that's the point of `Control<T>`.)

### v0.3 / ongoing — convenience & reach

- **`TrayApp`** convenience bundle, deferred; preserve standalone components and
  include a top-level broadcast receiver if restart recovery is promised.
- **Balloon / toast notifications** over `NotifyIcon`.
- A typed **`TrayEvent`** enum over the raw tray callback message (additive).
- A **ctor-arg-forwarding `create`** overload (once `std::forward` is taught).
- **`Drop` RAII view** — ✅ **Done (2026-07-12; built on request, superseding its
  parked status).** `winwrap/drop.hpp`: `class Drop final`, move-only owner of
  the `HDROP` (`DragFinish` in the destructor and on move-assign; hand-written
  Rule of Five, the `NotifyIcon` precedent), with `count()` / `path(i)` /
  `paths()` / `point()` / `handle()` hiding the sentinel-index + length-probe
  protocol. Covers the beyond-the-hook needs: drop coordinates
  (`DragQueryPoint`), count-only rejection without unpacking, lazy per-file
  access. `make_dropped_paths` is now `Drop{drop}.paths()` (its `wil::scope_exit`
  guard is gone — the view *is* the RAII); the mixin's hook is unchanged, purely
  additive. Renamed free-function pass-throughs over `DragQueryFileW` stay
  **rejected** per the LIBRARY_CONVENTIONS thin-wrapper rule (renames don't fix
  the protocol and break MSDN searchability). Tested via fabricated `DROPFILES`
  blocks: count/path/paths/point + move-transfer.
- **`FileDroppable` self-registration** — ✅ **Done (2026-07-13).** The mixin now
  calls `DragAcceptFiles(hwnd(), TRUE)` itself at `WM_NCCREATE` — guarded on the
  final type defining `on_files_dropped` (`if constexpr (requires …)`), so a
  handler-less compose registers, and leaks, nothing. A drop window is now just
  `Window<T, FileDroppable>` + the hook — no `.ex_style = WS_EX_ACCEPTFILES` at
  the call site. Registration rides `WM_NCCREATE` as a pass-through: `WW_CASE`
  returns 0 (which would abort creation) and the built-in `Lifecycle` already
  claims `WM_CREATE`, so neither hook path was available. Tested against a real
  created window (self-registration bit set).
- **`DropZone` premade window** — ❌ **Removed (2026-07-13).** Built 2026-07-12,
  deleted the next day. A window whose *only* job is to be a drop bucket is the
  ~1% case, and with `FileDroppable` self-registering (above) the mixin path is a
  two-liner the premade window earned nothing over. Same §3 reasoning that
  retired the `DropAcceptance` toggle: no real consumer, so no wrapper. Its
  self-registration test moved onto the mixin. *(The historical design notes in
  `MESSAGE_LOOP_DESIGN.md` / `PRE_V01_PROMPTS.md` keep their DropZone mentions as
  a record of the path taken.)*
- **`fs.hpp` + `shell.hpp`** — ✅ **Done (2026-07-30).** `fs.hpp`: `file_attributes`
  (hides the `INVALID_FILE_ATTRIBUTES` sentinel), `set_file_attributes`, and the two
  read-modify-write intent verbs `add_file_attributes` / `remove_file_attributes` (the
  latter falls back to `FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL`, since Win32 has no zero mask). All take
  `const std::filesystem::path&` — on Windows `path::c_str()` is already `wchar_t*`, so
  the `…W` call costs no conversion. `shell.hpp`: `refresh_folder` over
  `SHChangeNotify(SHCNE_UPDATEDIR, …)`. Four Catch2 tests. Built because icon-dropper's
  `set_folder_icon` had bare `…W` calls in its logic; the "wait for a second consumer"
  trigger explicitly does **not** gate wrapping a raw Win32 call (see
  `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md` §3).
- More **RAII-wrapped Win32 objects** as real projects need them.
- **Catch2 tests** that exercise behaviour without a live message pump.

### Later

- **C++17 backport** via preprocessor feature-gating + `nonstd::expected`
  (expected-lite) where `std::expected` is absent. Keep the API backport-friendly
  meanwhile.
- Catch2 tests that exercise behaviour without a live message pump.
